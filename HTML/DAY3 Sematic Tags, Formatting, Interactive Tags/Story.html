            <p>A boy asked his grandfather,<b> "Grandpa, why is life so difficult?"</b> The grandfather smiled, pointed to a cup of tea, and said "If you stir sugar in it, the tea becomes sweet. But the sugar was already there. You just needed to mix it"Then he added:"Life also has sweetness in it. You just have to stir it with the right thoughts"</p>

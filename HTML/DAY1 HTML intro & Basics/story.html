        <h1>Life's Sweetness</h1>
        <p>
            A boy asked his grandfather,
            "Grandpa, why is life so difficult?"
            The grandfather smiled, pointed to a cup of tea, and said
            "If you stir sugar in it, the tea becomes sweet.
             But the sugar was already there.
             You just needed to mix it"Then he added:"Life also has sweetness in it. 
             You just have to stir it with the right thoughts"
             "Life doesn,t always need to change. Somethings, 
             only the way you think about it needed stirring."
